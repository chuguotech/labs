            The try/finally is here so that if someone passes a WSGI level
            iterator in we're still running the cleanup logic.  Generators
            don't need that because they are closed on their destruction
            automatically.

            try:
                yield from gen
            finally:
                if hasattr(gen, "close"):
                    gen.close()

    # The trick is to start the generator.  Then the code execution runs until
    # the first dummy None is yielded at which point the context was already
    # pushed.  This item is discarded.  Then when the iteration continues the
    # real generator is executed.
    wrapped_g = generator()
    next(wrapped_g)
    return wrapped_g
