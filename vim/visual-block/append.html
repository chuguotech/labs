    Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.
    And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. 
    And with a great voice he said:
    When love beckons to you, follow him,
    Though his ways are hard and steep.
    And when his wings enfold you yield to him,
    Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
